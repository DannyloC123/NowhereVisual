# NowhereVisual

This is just a project I was intersted in doing a while back, but wanted wo wawit until free/cheaper and better AI's came out.

I have used Sora to create some trippy short videos to post on the NowhereVisual instagram account. All I did was store a few of these videos as well as some hashtags to cycle through. Then I will use Python to choose random hashtags and post 3 videos everyday.
